## ðŸ§­ Contributing to RemoteVars

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to **RemoteVars**! ðŸŽ‰  
This project aims to simplify environment variable management by fetching configs from remote sources like GitHub, HTTP, or local files â€” no more messy `.env` files everywhere.

Weâ€™re excited to have your ideas, feedback, and code improvements!
